### 2. DETAILED CRITERIA ANALYSIS

#### Criterion I - Nature of Protected Legal Interest
**Weight**: 1.5×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 4/5  
**Weighted Score**: 6.0

**Analysis**: The injury affected multiple fundamental rights: physical integrity (loss of fingers), health (chronic pain, ongoing medical needs), and psychological well-being (diagnosed anxiety and depression).

**Justification**: Score of 4 reflects violation of critical rights (health and physical integrity) with permanent consequences. Not scored 5 as life itself was not directly threatened.

#### Criterion II - Intensity of Suffering or Humiliation
**Weight**: 1.5×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 4/5  
**Weighted Score**: 6.0

**Analysis**: The worker experienced severe acute pain during the incident, underwent multiple surgeries, endured 6 months of painful rehabilitation, and continues to suffer chronic pain requiring medication. Additionally, psychological suffering includes diagnosed anxiety and depression.

**Justification**: Score of 4 reflects high intensity of both physical and psychological suffering, though not at the absolute maximum level.

#### Criterion III - Possibility of Physical or Psychological Recovery
**Weight**: 2.5×  
**Logic**: **Inverse**  
**Score**: 5/5  
**Weighted Score**: 12.5

**Analysis**: The injury is permanent and irreversible. The lost fingers cannot be restored. While psychological treatment may help with anxiety and depression, the physical disability and its consequences are lifelong.

**Justification**: Score of 5 (inverse logic) reflects zero possibility of full recovery, which maximally aggravates the damage severity.

#### Criterion IV - Personal and Social Repercussions
**Weight**: 1.0×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 4/5  
**Weighted Score**: 4.0

**Analysis**: Significant impact on professional life (cannot perform previous role, reduced earning capacity), family life (financial stress, emotional burden on family), and social life (loss of manual dexterity affects daily activities and hobbies).

**Justification**: Score of 4 reflects substantial repercussions across multiple life domains.

#### Criterion V - Extent and Duration of Effects
**Weight**: 2.0×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 5/5  
**Weighted Score**: 10.0

**Analysis**: The effects are both extensive (physical disability, chronic pain, psychological trauma, reduced earning capacity) and permanent (lifelong duration).

**Justification**: Score of 5 reflects maximum extent and duration - permanent, irreversible consequences.

#### Criterion VI - Conditions Under Which Offense Occurred
**Weight**: 1.0×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 4/5  
**Weighted Score**: 4.0

**Analysis**: Highly aggravating circumstances: employer's failure to provide mandatory safety equipment, lack of training, previous complaints ignored, and incident occurred in front of colleagues (adding humiliation element).

**Justification**: Score of 4 reflects seriously negligent conditions with multiple aggravating factors.

#### Criterion VII - Degree of Intent or Fault
**Weight**: 1.2×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 4/5  
**Weighted Score**: 4.8

**Analysis**: While not intentional harm, the employer demonstrated gross negligence: failed to provide mandatory safety equipment, ignored worker's safety complaints, and did not provide required training. This represents serious culpability.

**Justification**: Score of 4 reflects high degree of fault (gross negligence), though not intentional harm.

#### Criterion VIII - Spontaneous Retraction
**Weight**: 0.6×  
**Logic**: **Inverse**  
**Score**: 5/5  
**Weighted Score**: 3.0

**Analysis**: The employer did not apologize, did not acknowledge wrongdoing, and showed no remorse for the incident.

**Justification**: Score of 5 (inverse logic) reflects complete absence of retraction, which aggravates the offense.

#### Criterion IX - Effort to Mitigate the Damage
**Weight**: 0.8×  
**Logic**: **Inverse**  
**Score**: 5/5  
**Weighted Score**: 4.0

**Analysis**: The employer provided only the legal minimum required and made no additional efforts to assist the worker. No rehabilitation support, no job accommodation efforts, no financial assistance beyond legal obligations.

**Justification**: Score of 5 (inverse logic) reflects complete absence of mitigation efforts, aggravating the damage.

#### Criterion X - Express or Tacit Forgiveness
**Weight**: 1.0×  
**Logic**: **Inverse**  
**Score**: 5/5  
**Weighted Score**: 5.0

**Analysis**: The worker has not forgiven the employer and had to hire legal representation to pursue the claim, indicating ongoing conflict and lack of reconciliation.

**Justification**: Score of 5 (inverse logic) reflects absence of forgiveness, suggesting the emotional wound remains unhealed.

#### Criterion XI - Economic Situation of the Parties
**Weight**: 1.0×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 3/5  
**Weighted Score**: 3.0

**Analysis**: The worker has moderate financial needs (family to support, $2,000 monthly salary) and the employer is a medium-sized company with capacity to pay. The disparity is notable but not extreme.

**Justification**: Score of 3 reflects moderate economic considerations - neither minimal nor maximal impact.

#### Criterion XII - Degree of Publicity of the Offense
**Weight**: 0.5×  
**Logic**: Direct  
**Score**: 2/5  
**Weighted Score**: 1.0

**Analysis**: The incident occurred in front of other workers (adding some humiliation), but there was no broader public disclosure or media coverage.

**Justification**: Score of 2 reflects limited publicity - witnessed by colleagues but not publicly exposed.

### 3. FINAL CALCULATION

**Total Weighted Score**: 63.3 points

**Breakdown**:
- Criterion I: 4 × 1.5 = 6.0
- Criterion II: 4 × 1.5 = 6.0
- Criterion III: 5 × 2.5 = 12.5
- Criterion IV: 4 × 1.0 = 4.0
- Criterion V: 5 × 2.0 = 10.0
- Criterion VI: 4 × 1.0 = 4.0
- Criterion VII: 4 × 1.2 = 4.8
- Criterion VIII: 5 × 0.6 = 3.0
- Criterion IX: 5 × 0.8 = 4.0
- Criterion X: 5 × 1.0 = 5.0
- Criterion XI: 3 × 1.0 = 3.0
- Criterion XII: 2 × 0.5 = 1.0

**TOTAL**: 63.3 points

### 4. CLASSIFICATION

**Severity Level**: **SEVERE**

**Position within range**: Lower-middle portion of SEVERE range (51-68 points)

**Suggested Compensation Range**: 12-15× monthly salary = **$24,000 - $30,000**

**Justification**: The score of 63.3 places this case solidly in the SEVERE category. The permanent nature of the injury, combined with employer's gross negligence and lack of mitigation efforts, justify compensation in the lower-middle portion of the severe range.

### 5. CONCLUSION

**Summary**:
This case presents a severe workplace injury with permanent consequences resulting from employer negligence. The most significant factors are the permanent, irreversible nature of the injury (Criteria III and V, contributing 22.5 weighted points) and the violation of fundamental rights to health and physical integrity.

**Key Aggravating Factors**:
- Permanent disability with zero possibility of recovery (12.5 points)
- Lifelong duration and extensive effects (10.0 points)
- Gross negligence by employer (4.8 points)
- Complete absence of apology, mitigation efforts, or reconciliation (12.0 points combined)
- Violation of multiple fundamental rights (6.0 points)

**Key Mitigating Factors**:
- Limited publicity (minimal impact: 1.0 point)
- Moderate (not extreme) economic disparity (3.0 points)

**Final Recommendation**:
Compensation of **$24,000 to $30,000** (12-15× monthly salary) is appropriate and proportional to the severity of the damage. This reflects the permanent nature of the injury, the employer's culpability, and the comprehensive impact on the worker's life, while remaining within established legal parameters for severe injuries.

**Important Notes**:
- This assessment assumes all facts as presented are verified by evidence
- Final compensation should be adjusted based on any additional evidence or circumstances not included in this analysis
- Local precedents and jurisdictional standards should be consulted for final determination
- The worker's ongoing medical and psychological treatment needs should be separately addressed
